              We’ve neared the end of the pandemic, COVID-19. That means travelers
              would like to get back to visiting family and traveling the unknown.
              During this pandemic, all companies complied with the CDC to make
              sure that all guests of any sort were met with the peace fo mind
              that the establishment they were visiting, was safe. Trutrip’s goal
              is to accomodate to that, giving travelers the best deals for
              flights, hotels and rental cars, as well display sanitation records
              and reviews.

            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
              Hotels are known for the lack of sanitization when cleaning rooms
              after other guests, in result, travelers are looking at other
              options of stay when traveling as there is no way of knowing where
              its clean to sleep while away.

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
              To incorporate user reviews into our travel app, it’ll allow
              people to rate their stay as well give the company a sanitation
              rating, allowing other users to know which places are best to
              visit when traveling.

        <h4>User Research</h4>
        <h5>Interviews</h5>
        <p>I launched my research with conducting interview questions to gather qualatative and quanitative data to cover a variety of topics such as most reliable/favorite travel apps, customer reviews overview, pains and gains from the current market of apps, and the logistics going into planning a vacation. After conducting 5 interviews via Zoom, I concluded many users rely on personal reviews from customers; but don’t necessarily leave reviews. As well, many apps present unneccessary deals, prices, and extras that users are not interested with, leaving them with wanting a more simplistic, more staright to the point experience. The age demographic targeted for interviews was 20 to 40 years old. </p>

            <p>“I think I know it’s been less relaxing, just they have so much information they're trying to present to you, It can seem a little like dense or like crowded,  which I know for me personally, like they seem to make my experience a little more fun and pleasurable.”

            <p>“I look at Yelp reviews, quite a bit to see, you know, especially for hotels or restaurants or places I'm going to visit. And I feel like people's personal experiences impact a lot of times my decision on, you know, where I do choose to dine or to stay.”
