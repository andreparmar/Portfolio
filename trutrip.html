              We’ve neared the end of the pandemic, COVID-19. That means
              travelers would like to return to visiting family and traveling
              the unknown. During this pandemic, all companies complied with the
              CDC standards to ensure that all guests of any sort were met with
              peace of mind. Trutrip’s goal is to accommodate that, giving
              travelers the best deals for flights, hotels, and rental cars;
              displaying sanitation records as well as reviews.

            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
              Hotels are known for the lack of sanitization when cleaning rooms
              after other guests, as a result, travelers are looking at
              alternatives of stay when traveling as there is no way of knowing
              where it’s clean to sleep while away.

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
              Incorporating user reviews into our travel app, it’ll allow people
              to rate their stay as well as give the company a sanitation
              rating, allowing other users to know which places are best to
              visit when traveling.

          <h5>Interviews</h5>
          <p>
            I launched my research by conducting interviews to gather
            qualitative and quantitative data to cover a variety of topics such
            as the most reliable and favorite travel apps, customer reviews and
            overview, pains and gains from the current market of apps, and the
            logistics going into planning a vacation. After conducting 5
            interviews via Zoom, I concluded many users rely on personal reviews
            from customers; but don’t necessarily leave reviews. As well, many
            apps present unnecessary deals, prices, and extras that users are
            not interested in, leaving them wanting a more simplistic, more
            straight-to-the-point experience. The age demographic targeted for
            interviews was 20 to 46 years old.

          <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
          <p>
            Winding down this project, I have a few key takeaways I’d like to
            carry over in future work. As this was my first case study with the
            Bootcamp; I took away many standards, workflows, and fundamentals.
            The final version of this product is still far from done
            “design-wise”.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="final-contain">
          <h5>What's next?</h5>
          <p>
            I’d like to iterate the high fidelity design, gather more statistics
            for reservation pages, and improve on one single flow, rather than
            the whole app. My research is strong I am confident if I cumulated a
            team of professionals, we could take this app public, increasing the
            safety of all future travelers going forward.
